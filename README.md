### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Animadversio)

I study computational neuroscience. I use deep generative models, optimization methods, and differential geometry to investigate visual representations in the brain and in the neural networks. 

Quick Bio
- I am currently a Neuroscience Ph.D. student working with professor [Carlos R. Ponce](https://ponce.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard medical School. 
  - Before the lab moved to HMS, we were affiliated with Washington University in St Louis.
- I obtained B.S. in Physics at Peking University, in Yuanpei College, adviced by theoretical neuroscientist [Louis Tao](https://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/people/cbifaculty/265951.htm). 
- My [academic website](https://scholar.harvard.edu/binxuw/home) with my teaching slides and papers. 
- My [personal website](https://animadversio.github.io/) with my notes on math, ML and fun projects!
